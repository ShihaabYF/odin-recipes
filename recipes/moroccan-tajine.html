        <h3>A brief and general introduction to the Chicken Tajine.</h3>
        <p>A classic dish, <strong>this Moroccan chicken recipe</strong> uses preserved lemons, olives, and onions. It can be cooked in an <strong><a href="./../img/tajine/tajine-pics.html">authentic tagine</a></strong>  or roasted in the oven, depending on your preference, and what equipment you have at your disposal. Either way, you'll enjoy a <em>delicious</em> meal that is sure to please everyone at the dinner table.</p>
        <p>
            This recipe includes a number of traditional Moroccan ingredients, such as preserved lemons (which you can make yourself or purchase in specialty shops or online), smen, a kind of preserved butter, and the Moroccan spice blend ras el hanout. Since the olives, lemons, and smen are salty, don't be too liberal with the salt in this recipeâ€”1/2 teaspoon or less. Just taste; you'll know.
